## What is dawbox ?

Dawbox is a project leveraging Cloud Native technologies to provide a ready-to-go Audio Production environment.  Its intended use-case is on Fedora Atomic and its derivatives like Universal Blue, though any Linux system with Distrobox will work :)

## Requirements

You will need:
- [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox)
- To be comfortable opening a terminal and running the install script in CLI

## Setup

Open your terminal of choice and run:
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Messaiga/DAWbox/refs/heads/main/install.sh -o install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

- Select 1 to check if dawbox is installed.
- Select 2 to install dawbox.
